This application tracks the current price of various cryptocurrencies. Users have the ability to see the current price of four cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple (XRP), and Kaspa. Users can also add cryptocurrencies of their choice by editing the code.

## Lessons Learned
During this project, I learned how to use an asynchronous function with a try statement and a catch statement to fetch data from an API with current cryptocurrency prices and return the data to be displayed in an .html file. I also learned how to design a visually appealing and easy-to-understand user interface for displaying data. 

## Improvements
One improvement would be to have the ability to select which cryptocurrency prices the user would like displayed from the API using a search function. Currently, the application only has the ability to display the cryptocurrencies that are hard coded into the application.
